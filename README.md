Purdue ECE661:Computer Vision -- lab code
This repository is a demo of ECE661 homework(or lab) code, the homework topics are listed as following:

Homework 2.
This assignment deals with projective distortion in camera images and with estimating homographies between images.

Homework 3.
The homework deals with removing projective and affine distortions.

Homework 4. 
This homework deals with interest points detection in images and with establishing correspondences between interest points of two images
of the same scene. Algorithms used are Harris corner detection, SIFT.
