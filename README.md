Purdue ECE661:Computer Vision -- lab code
This repository is a demonstration of ECE661 homework(or lab) code, the homework topics are listed as below:

Homework 2.
This assignment deals with projective distortion in camera images and with estimating homographies between images.

Homework 3.
The homework deals with removing projective and affine distortions.

Homework 4. 
This homework deals with interest points detection in images and with establishing correspondences between interest points of two images
of the same scene. Algorithms used are Harris corner detection, SIFT.

Homework 5.
This homework deals with image mosaicing techinque to stitch several images together using homographies.

Homework 6. 
This homework deals with image segmentation. Algorithms used aer Otsu's algorithm and texture based segmentation.
